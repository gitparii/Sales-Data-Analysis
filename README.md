##Exploratory Data Analysis
-One of the project's highlights is the exploratory data analysis (EDA). We'll visualize sales and profit trends over time, which will      provide valuable insights into the company's performance. This analysis will help uncover patterns, identify areas of improvement, and support data-driven decision-making.
